4-B: Let's create a program to calculate the mean and standard deviation of a
column of numbers in two different ways. Follow the data below.

| Data = x |
| :--------: |
| 17.4     |
| 18.1     |
| 18.2     |
| 17.9     |
| 17.6     |

With these data find:

a) mean

b) x values ​​- mean

c) values found in item b squared

d) standard deviation

4-G: Calibration curve.  In the Bradford protein determination, the color of a dye
changes from brown to blue when it binds to protein. Absorbance of
light is measured.

| Protein  | Absorbance (595 nm)|
|:--------:|:--------------:|
|  0.00    |     0.466      |
|  9.36    |     0.676      |
|  18.72   |     0.883      |
|  28.08   |     1.086      |
|  37.44   |     1.280      |

With these data do the linear regression treatment and show your graph
