**Exercise 2.26** 


The efficiency of a gas chromatography column is measured by a parameter called
plate height (H, mm), which is related to the gas flow rate (u, mL/min) by the 
van Deemter equation: H = A + B/u + Cu, where A, B, and C are constants. Prepare
a spreadsheet with a graph showing values of H as a function of u
for u =  4, 6, 8, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 and 100 mL/min. Use the 
values A = 1.65 mm, B = 25.8 mm X mL/min and c = 0.02336 mm X min/m
